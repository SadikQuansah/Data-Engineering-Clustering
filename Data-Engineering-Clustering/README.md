# Data engineering - Clustering

Up to now, we mainly had a `y` variable in our problems. The domain of problems where a label variable is present are called supervised learning (we're supervising the algorithm with the target variable). What do we do if there is no target variable for us instead?

The domain of problems without a target variable is called [unsupervised learning](https://www.guru99.com/unsupervised-machine-learning.html) and includes clustering.

## The Clustering Problem

Given a matrix of observations `X`, label each observation into one of `k` categories, called "clusters". Some algorithms for you to choose `k` in advance, whereas others learn `k` by themselves.
