Reorganize the clusters so that each of your learned clusters labels overlap with the true label (eg. if the digit 4 has the cluster label 9, you want to remap it to 4).

Now that your cluster labels are matched to the supervised learning labels, check the classification accuracy of your clustering model (accuracy score and confusion matrix).
